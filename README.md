***Birti Mattia***  
This folder contains the DeepLearning course project from the University of Milan Bicocca. It consists of 3 notebooks that contain the code to perform image classification using convolutional neural networks.

## Contents

### 1) CNN from Scratch - Jupyter Notebook
This Jupyter Notebook contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch using Python and common libraries like NumPy. The notebook demonstrates the basic building blocks of a CNN, such as convolutional layers, activation functions, and pooling layers, without relying on high-level deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.  

**Contents**
* Explanation of CNN layers and their operations.
* Step-by-step implementation of the forward and backward passes.
* Sample usage with a simple dataset for image classification.


### 2) CNN with MobileNetV2 - Jupyter Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to implement and fine-tune the MobileNetV2 architecture for image classification tasks using Python. The notebook leverages popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or Keras to utilize MobileNetV2, a lightweight and efficient CNN model designed for mobile and embedded devices.

**Contents**
* Introduction to MobileNetV2 architecture.
* Loading pre-trained MobileNetV2 and fine-tuning on a custom dataset.
* Training, evaluation, and performance analysis of the model on an image classification task.

### 3) CNN with VGG16 - Jupyter Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook focuses on the implementation and fine-tuning of the VGG16 architecture for image classification. VGG16 is a deep Convolutional Neural Network known for its simplicity and effectiveness in tasks like image recognition.
